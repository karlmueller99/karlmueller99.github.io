    <h1>San Francisco: The best and the worst</h1>
    
    <h2>The best neighborhood is <strong>Mission district</strong></h2>
    
    <p>I like it because the food is really great! It also is near my favorite skatepark, and you can experience many diffrent cultures. </p> 
    
    <h2>The worst neighborhood is civic center <em>Tenderloin</em></h2>
    
    <p>There is sadly a lot of garbage on the floor and it is filled with homeless people and drug abusers.</p>
